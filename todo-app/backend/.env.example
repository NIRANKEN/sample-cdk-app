# Example JWT claims for local testing (sub is usually the user ID)
# You would typically get a real JWT from your auth provider for actual testing
# For createTodo, the event JSON should contain requestContext.authorizer.jwt.claims.sub
# This is just an example, the invoke-local.js script doesn't automatically inject this into the event.
# You need to structure your event JSON file (e.g., events/createTodoEvent.json) correctly.
